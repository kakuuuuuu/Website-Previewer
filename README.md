# Website-Previewer
Test Project for using HTML Scraping tools as well as Regex practices.  Allows user to type anything and detects if the input contains a valid URL.  The URL once detected is sent to the server and pulls the website's HTML (if the website exists).  The HTML is then sent back to the front end and scraped for elements for previewing.
